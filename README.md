This is a NumPy/PyTorch tutorial for [CSE 447/517 NLP class (Winter 2021)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBz2w79DBrGjNGq2TMqJBDIWzUGsQacWFAszZKz6OKI/edit#) at the University of Washington. It is divided into three parts: [01_numpy_tutorial.py](01_numpy_tutorial.py) introduces basic NumPy concepts, [02_pytorch_tutorial.py](02_pytorch_tutorial.py) explains auto-differentiation with PyTorch and walks through a toy multinomial logistic regression classifier in depth, and [03_sentiment_classification_example.py](03_sentiment_classification_example.py) is a more realistic example that handles tokenization, out-of-vocabulary tokens, grouping together and padding similar-lengthed texts, a fairly sophisticated model, GPU utilization, etc. These files (or at least the first two) are designed to be walked through in part of a 50-minute section, so they are quite brief. Each file contains pointers to more comprehensive introductions and examples.
You can install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. PyTorch may be a bit more complicated with certain systems and/or CUDA drivers. Refer to the install instruction in [their official website](https://pytorch.org/) if you run into any issue.
